# Digital Clock Lite KDE Applet
org.kde.plasma.digitalclocklite

Fork from org.kde.plasma.digitalclock, with a feature to choose the size of the clock

This was an attempt to show milliseconds on the display, but it seems that it only refreshes the display (approximately) once every second anyway so it doesn't work other than small fluxuation(likely from lag).
